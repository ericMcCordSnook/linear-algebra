List of Updates

1. Allow equations with missing variables and variables in different orders (do 3 and 4 first)
	a) take all variables present into an array
	b) associate coefficients with variables
	c) assign a value of 0 any missing variables
	d) print solution as "variable = value"
	
2. Allow doubles as coefficients on a system-by-system basis (do 5 first)

5. DoubleFrac class extends Fraction

6. Develop polynomial class to hold an entire equation

7. Develop equation class to manipulate an equation to solve for a variable analytically
